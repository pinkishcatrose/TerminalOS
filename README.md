# TerminalOS
TerminalOS is a fancy ripoff of MS-DOS that runs in your terminal, and can interact with your Host OS to automate tasks.

TerminalOSJ is capable of listing and running .jar and .bat files within its "Applications" folder (automated process coming soon don't worry)

# Launching TerminalOS
Double-click on the .jar file, and it will create a launch script on your desktop. open that and your good to go

**Java 17 is required, TerminalOS will not launch without it**
